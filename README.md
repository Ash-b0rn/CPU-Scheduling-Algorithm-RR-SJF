# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm-RR-SJF(Preemptive and Non-preemptive)
This project contains Java implementations of two CPU scheduling algorithms: Shortest-Job-First (SJF) , both preemptive and non-preemptive, and Round Robin. All of the algorithms can be found in the Main file.

## SJF Preemptive
The SRTF algorithm is a preemptive scheduling algorithm that schedules processes based on the remaining burst time of each process.

## SJF Non-Preeptive
The SRTF algorithm is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm that schedules processes based on the remaining burst time of each process.

## Round Robin
THe RR is a FIFO algorithm that is based on time slices called "quantum", each process is held in the CPU for the "quantum" amount then the next process is places in the CPU and the prevoid one is placed again at the begining of the queue.
